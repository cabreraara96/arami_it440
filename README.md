# Data Pipeline Project Repository

*"Let all things be done decently and in order." — 1 Corinthians 14:40*  

## Purpose
This repository organizes and manages all components of my data pipeline projects, including Databricks notebooks, SQL scripts, Python ETL workflows, and sample datasets. The goal is to ensure that code is reproducible, well-documented, and easy to maintain, while using GitHub for version control.  

Just as thoughtful order in our lives brings clarity and strength, maintaining a structured repository ensures reliability and reproducibility in data projects.

|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **notebooks/**    | Databricks or Jupyter notebooks used for ETL tasks                     |
| **sql/**          | Independent SQL transformation files                                   |
| **etl_pipeline/** | Python scripts or workflow files used for automation                  |
| **data_samples/** | Small example datasets for testing                                     |
| **README.md**     | Explanation of repository, folder structure, and instructions         |

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository into your Databricks workspace via **Repos → Add Repo**.  
2. Save and version-control notebooks, SQL scripts, and workflows directly in GitHub.  
3. Use the `data_samples/` folder for testing ETL processes before applying them to full datasets.  
4. Follow the folder structure to keep code organized and maintainable.

## Reflection
Maintaining a structured repository mirrors the importance of order and preparation in life. Thoughtful organization of notebooks, scripts, and datasets ensures reproducibility and reliability, just as careful planning builds a strong foundation in personal and professional projects.
